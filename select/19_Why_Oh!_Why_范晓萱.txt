Why don't you say that you love me?
Why don't you say that you care
I can be yours
You can be mine
We can go to the heaven together
Why don't you say that you fear me?
Why don't you say that you don't?
I can be nice
You can be cruel
We can play good from now till forever
Why can't you say it? Why oh why?
Why can't you love me? Why?
What can't it be? Why oh why?
What will it be? Why?
Why oh why?

Why don't you say that you fear me?

Why don't you say that you don't?

You can be cruel
We can play good from now till forever
Why can't you say it? Why oh why?
Why can't you love me? Why?
What can't it be? Why oh why?
What will it be? Why?
Why oh why?
