Everybody goin' out and having fun
I'm just a fool for stayin' home and havin' none
I can't get over how she set me free

Oh, lonesome me

Bad mistake I'm making by just hangin' around
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool who's blind and just can't see

Oh, lonesome me

Well, I bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy-free
Flirting with the boys with all her charm
I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z

Oh, lonesome me

Well, I bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy-free
Flirting with the boys with all her charm
I still love her so and brother don't you know
Welcome her right back here in my arms

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z

Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
